        <summary>Abstract:</summary>

        How do institutional contexts influence the effect of judge identities on decisions? Identities affect judge behavior when the legal question before the judge is salient to their identity. I argue that when judges lack the independence to make these connections, the influence of identities diminishes. I study immigration courts, where an immigrant identity would be naturally salient to judge decisions but for the lack of discretion. I collect an original dataset on judge backgrounds and analyzed two consequential immigration decisions: the granting of continuances and relief decisions from deportation. I find that with discretion judges with immigrant backgrounds will be more likely to grant continuances. In contrast to previous findings in judicial politics, without discretion the connection between their identity and outcomes becomes insignificant. I provide a novel institutional explanation for the relationship between judge identities and law and a novel focus on how immigrant identities can affect judicial behavior.
